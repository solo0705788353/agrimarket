AgriMarket is an online advertising and marketing platform for agricultural produce all over Kenya. This solution is a combination of a website and an android application that farmers and transport producers install in their phones.
Kenya is a country that has a wide range of climatic conditions. In some places it is cold and dry while some places hot and wet, this supports different types of agricultural practices. There is therefore a need to bridge that gap by ensuring that there is proper distribution of agricultural produce. For instance, someone in Turkana can be able to order 5 bags of maize and have it delivered right at their doorstep.
AgriMarket platform provides means for the farmers to connect with the consumers and eliminate unnecessary middle men who take a huge chunk of their returns. The farmers are able to manage their inventories from one dashboard. The consumer on the other side are able to view a range of products from dairy products cereals, to farm machinery.
When a consumer places an order for a product, they will be connected to a transport service automatically by an algorithm that picks a suitable transport vehicle. The algorithm uses the quantity of the produce and the distance between the consumer and the farmer. The consumer is able to pay on delivery of the product using Lipa na Mpesa or Cash.
